# Neovim-Curry
## Neovim, the Curry edition
This is my own personal Neovim configuration, inspired by my dog Curry. I've
kept things lightweight and simple while still maintaining useful features such
as LSP functionality and Github Copilot, which I use in my day-to-day work.
Feel free to try it out for yourself or make suggestions, I'd love to hear
feedback.
I give much credit and thanks to [Christian Chiarulli](github.com/ChristianChiarulli) for his work
on creating a wonderful Neovim base config to build upon.
